## Key Concepts

These are the fundamental topics I have explored and implemented in C++:

- **2D Array**: Working with multidimensional arrays for matrix-based problems.
- **Array**: Basics of arrays, operations, and common problems (e.g., finding the maximum, rotating arrays).
- **Backtracking**: Techniques for solving problems by trying every possible option (e.g., N-Queens, Sudoku solver).
- **Binary Search**: Efficient search algorithms for sorted arrays with logarithmic complexity.
- **Binary Search Tree (BST)**: Tree data structure where every node follows the BST property.
- **Binary Tree**: General tree structure with a maximum of two children.
- **Graphs**: Representing networks of nodes and edges, exploring BFS, DFS, and shortest path algorithms.
- **Hashmaps**: Associative arrays (hash tables) for fast lookups and retrieval.
- **Heaps**: Priority queues and heap data structures for efficient access to the minimum/maximum element.
- **Linked Lists**: Singly and doubly linked lists for dynamic data storage and manipulation.
- **Queue**: First-In-First-Out (FIFO) data structure with different types (circular, priority).
- **Recursion**: Solving problems by breaking them down into subproblems with recursive functions.
- **Sorting**: Various sorting algorithms (e.g., Quick Sort, Merge Sort, Bubble Sort).
- **Stack**: Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) data structure with real-world applications.
- **Trie**: Efficient tree data structure for string storage and prefix-based searching.
